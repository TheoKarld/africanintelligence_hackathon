# **Course Pages UX Improvements & Bug Fixes Report**

## **Overview**

This report documents the UX enhancements and bug fixes implemented across key course-related pages in the application. The updates focus on improving navigation, addressing critical enrollment workflow issues, and enhancing the overall user experience through better content organization.

The following components and pages were updated:

* `CourseDetail.jsx`
* `CourseOverview.jsx`
* `EnrollButton.jsx`
* `CourseContent.jsx`

---

# **1. Navigation Improvements**

## **Problem**

Users had no intuitive way to navigate back from the **Course Detail** or **Course Overview** pages. This caused friction, especially for students who frequently moved between course lists and detail views.

### Issues Identified:

* Lack of back navigation resulted in users relying on browser back button.
* Navigation felt “trapped” inside course pages.
* Increased user confusion and reduced flow during exploration.

## **Solution**

Back navigation buttons were added to:

* **CourseDetail**
* **CourseOverview**

### Implementation Details:

* Introduced a dedicated “Back” button positioned consistently at the top-left of each page.
* Used appropriate icons (ChevronLeft / ArrowBack) for clarity.
* Ensured the navigation respects previous page context (e.g., course list → course detail → dashboard).

# **2. Enrollment Button Bug Fix**

## **Problem**

When students clicked the **Enroll** button:

* The button changed to “Processing…”
* After successful enrollment, the dialog closed
* But the button remained indefinitely in the “Processing” state
* This made users think the enrollment failed
* Some students clicked multiple times, causing double submissions or backend errors

### Root Causes:

* Loading state was not reset after successful enrollment.
* Navigation triggered before state cleanup.
* Dialog closure happened without updating UI state.

## **Solution**

A more predictable, stable enrollment flow was implemented.

### Fixes Applied:

* Dialog now **closes immediately** once enrollment succeeds.
* Loading state remains active **only until navigation completes**, preventing double enrollment.
* Button resets properly after route change.
* Improved state cleanup to avoid lingering "Processing" states.

### Result:

* Smooth enrollment flow
* No more indefinite loading
* Eliminates accidental double enrollment

# **3. Collapsible Course Modules (New UX Enhancement)**

## **Problem**

CourseContent displayed all modules expanded by default, causing:

* Long scrolling for courses with many modules
* Difficulty finding specific sections
* Poor mobile navigation experience

### Pain Points:

* Students had to scroll excessively to find lessons.
* No way to collapse or organize modules visually.
* The UI felt overwhelming for courses with 10+ modules.

## **Solution**

Modules were made **collapsible**, with a clean expand/collapse behavior.

### Implementation Details:

* Added a toggle button with chevron icons.
* Modules open by default for familiarity.
* Clicking the module header toggles visibility.
* Smooth UI interaction and improved reading hierarchy.

### Benefits:

* Cleaner, more intuitive course structure
* Faster navigation
* Better experience on mobile and small screens
